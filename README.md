## Business Case: luxury restaurants in Rome  

Hi, and welcome to this business case!  

[The notebook](https://github.com/andrea-dm/Luxury-Restaurants-in-Rome/blob/master/solution.ipynb) of this repository has been submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, and it has been graded 40/40 points by the community of Coursera.  
Here you may find our suggested solution to the problem of selecting the optimal neighborhood in Rome where to open a new luxury restaurant.

Please, have a look at [the report](https://github.com/andrea-dm/Luxury-Restaurants-in-Rome/blob/master/report.md) for further details about the problem and the suggested solution.  

---------------------------------------

_The analysis that we have conducted is very far from being complete and exhaustive.  
For instance, 4/5-stars hotels could be considered in the study as well, for the reason that such venues come along with high level restaurants most of the times. Plus, the information about population and income are not updated, hence they are susceptible to changes that might dramatically affect the results (e.g., data about PCI are dated 2015). Definitively, deeper inspections could be carried out and other drivers could be figured out.  
We defer similar investigations, for they would go way beyond the scope of such an assignment, which has been to some extent forced to match specific requirements set by the IBM Capstone Project such as the Foursquare API, whose limitations had the negative conseguence of restricting the number of venues that we could fetch._
