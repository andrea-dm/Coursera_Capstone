## Business Case: luxury restaurants in Rome  

Hi, and welcome to this business case!  

[The notebook](https://github.com/andrea-dm/Luxury-Restaurants-in-Rome/blob/master/solution.ipynb) that you find in this repository has been submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, and it has been graded 40/40 points by the community of Coursera.  
Here you may find our suggested solution to the problem of selecting the optimal neighborhood in Rome where to open a new luxury restaurant.

Please, have a look at [the report](https://github.com/andrea-dm/Luxury-Restaurants-in-Rome/blob/master/report.md) for further details about the problem and the suggested solution.  

---------------------------------------

_The analysis that we have conducted is very far from being complete and exhaustive.  
For instance, the limitations of the Foursquare API had the negative conseguence of restricting the number of venues that we could fetch. Plus, the information about population and income are not updated, hence they are susceptible to changes that might affect the results (e.g., data about PCI are dated 2015). Furthermore, deeper inspections can be carried out and other drivers figured out.  
We defer similar investigations for they would go far beyond the scope of such an assignment, which has been to some extent forced to match specific requirements set by the IBM Capstone Project._
